## Example Code

There is a working code example for Node.js in the [/examples](/examples) directory.

## CLI

There is a **very** simple CLI that will **UNSAFELY** decode a Truestamp ID and
display the data stored within. It is considered unsafe because it does not verify
the HMAC signature on the data since that key is only known to the service.

```sh
$ truestamp-id truestampKZKEECDT6D17Y5DDJ5WAJ963XSWDNRYRVVVTZ7ADG18R4JA9SK4D496BSCW34D6ZRF8D7N9NTZ13TE1HS6ZNH0R102ZYA2GQ

  id: '294jJ3YUoH1IEEm8GSabOs',
  version: 0
}
```
